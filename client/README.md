# Marketplace Frontend

This is the frontend of the **Marketplace** app, built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The app provides users with a marketplace to browse and purchase products. It interacts with the backend server to manage the cart, user authentication, and products.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows:

/frontend │ ├── /components # React components like ProductCard, Cart, etc. ├── /context # Context for managing global state (CartContext, WishlistContext) ├── /pages # Page components for different routes (Shop, ProductDetail, etc.) ├── /api # API client for interacting with the backend ├── /assets # Images, icons, and static files └── /styles # Tailwind CSS and custom styling ├── package.json # Project metadata and dependencies ├── .env # Environment variables for the project └── README.md # Project README



## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   
   git clone https://github.com/yinkus89/marketplace1.git
   cd marketplace/frontend
Install dependencies:


npm install





Create a .env file in the root of the /frontend directory and add the necessary environment variables. You may need to configure API URLs and other secrets here. For example:


REACT_APP_API_URL=https://4000-api-url.com
Development
To start the development server, run the following command:


npm run dev
This will launch the app in development mode and open it in your browser. The app will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

Build for Production
To build the app for production, run:



npm run build
This will create a build/ folder with the optimized production build. You can then deploy this build folder to any static file server.

Available Scripts
In addition to the default start and build commands, you can use these scripts:

Test: Run tests with the following command:


npm test
Lint: Run the linter to check for code quality issues:

bash
Code kopieren
npm run lint
Project Structure
/components: This directory contains reusable React components like ProductCard, Cart, etc.
/context: This directory holds the context for global state management (e.g., CartContext, WishlistContext).
/pages: Here, you will find page components like Shop, ProductDetail, etc.
/api: Contains the API client for interacting with the backend (RESTful API or GraphQL).
/assets: This folder stores images, icons, and other static files used throughout the app.
/styles: Tailwind CSS configuration and any custom CSS styles you define.
Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework.
Vite: A next-generation, fast build tool for modern web apps.
Deployment
For deployment, the app is ready to be hosted on any static hosting service (such as Render, Netlify, or Vercel). You will need to build the app using npm run build and upload the build folder to your chosen platform.
